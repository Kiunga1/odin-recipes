HTML basics.
In this project i create a recipe website.  the website is linked to several other pages each with a recipe of one of my favourite meals in Kenya.
it has enhanced my understading of  html tags and elements, the html boilerplate, adding lists to my website. Both ordered and unordered, linking my website to other web pages and adding images to my website. it has been a lovely journey.
