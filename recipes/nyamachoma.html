    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 kilogram of goat meat or beef</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
        <li>A cup of water</li>
        <li>1 large garlic</li>
        <li> 1 medium ginger</li>
        <li>1 large lemon</li>
        <li>1 pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the meat and let it dry Make incisions on the meat then place it in a bowl</li>
        <li>Make a mixture of grounded garlic, ginger, and lemon juice</li>
        <li>Add the mixture to the meat in the bowl and mix it up to marinate.</li>
        <li>Ensure the mix enters the cuts you have made.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and leave it for two hours (can be refrigerated.)</li>
        <li>Light a charcoal grill Wait for the coal to attain the desired temperature then place the meat over wire mesh.</li>
        <li>Add one tablespoon of salt to a little water. Mix it with a tablespoon of oil</li>
        <li>Sprinkle it on the meat as it cooks Keep turning the meat regularly for it to cook adequately on both sides</li>
        <li>The excess fat on the meat will help tenderize it as it cooks Once the exterior has turned golden brown.</li>
        <li>Slice the meat to check if it is cooked inside When the meat is ready, wrap it in a foil and place it on the grill having low heat as it waits to be served.</li>
    </ol>
