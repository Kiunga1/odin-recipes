    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>▢4 cup water, or more</li>
        <li>2 cup fine corn meal</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>PREPARATION</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add about 4 cups of water to a large heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add ½ teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, remove about a cup of water and set aside. </li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the cornmeal until you have added the whole thing to the pot, a little bit at a time, and keep stirring with a wooden spoon to prevent lumps. You may have to take the saucepan off the heat while getting rid of lumps and preventing burns.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and cook until the mixture thickens. </li>
        <li>Then add the remaining boiled water, reduce heat, cover, and cook for about 10 or more. You may add some more water if desired. Turn off the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Scoop out balls with a small bowl shake and form a ball by rolling around a bowl. Or place it on a saran wrap. Note: I have been told not to do this several times because of health reasons, so be mindful of it</li>
